a complex number can be represented as a string on the form "real+imaginaryi" where:
real is the real part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].
imaginary is the imaginary part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].
i2 == -1.
given two complex numbers num1 and num2 as strings, return a string of the complex number that represents their multiplications.
