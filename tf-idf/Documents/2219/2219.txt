we are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.
consider each adjacent pair of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  for each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.
return the decompressed list.
