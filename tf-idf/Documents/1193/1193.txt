you have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. you may rotate these shapes.
given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
in a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.
