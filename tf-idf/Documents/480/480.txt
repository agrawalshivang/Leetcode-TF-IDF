given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). it can be proven that there is a unique answer.
return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.
