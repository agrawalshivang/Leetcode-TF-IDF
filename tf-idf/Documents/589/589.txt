you are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.
every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. if this is impossible, return -1.
