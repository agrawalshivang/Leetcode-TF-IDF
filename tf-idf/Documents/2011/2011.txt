given the root of a binary search tree (bst), convert it to a greater tree such that every key of the original bst is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in bst.
as a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
