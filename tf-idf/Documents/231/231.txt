given a binary tree with the following rules:
root.val == 0
if treenode.val == x and treenode.left != null, then treenode.left.val == 2 * x + 1
if treenode.val == x and treenode.right != null, then treenode.right.val == 2 * x + 2
now the binary tree is contaminated, which means all treenode.val have been changed to -1.
implement the findelements class:
findelements(treenode* root) initializes the object with a contaminated binary tree and recovers it.
bool find(int target) returns true if the target value exists in the recovered binary tree.
