you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums whose length is a power of 2.
apply the following algorithm on nums:
let n be the length of nums. if n == 1, end the process. otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array newnums of length n / 2.
for every even index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newnums[i] as min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).
for every odd index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newnums[i] as max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).
replace the array nums with newnums.
repeat the entire process starting from step 1.
return the last number that remains in nums after applying the algorithm.
