given an n x n binary grid, in one step you can choose two adjacent rows of the grid and swap them.
a grid is said to be valid if all the cells above the main diagonal are zeros.
return the minimum number of steps needed to make the grid valid, or -1 if the grid cannot be valid.
the main diagonal of a grid is the diagonal that starts at cell (1, 1) and ends at cell (n, n).
