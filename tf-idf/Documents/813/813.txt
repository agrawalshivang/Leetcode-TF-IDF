you are given two integer arrays persons and times. in an election, the ith vote was cast for persons[i] at time times[i].
for each query at a time t, find the person that was leading the election at time t. votes cast at time t will count towards our query. in the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.
implement the topvotedcandidate class:
topvotedcandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) initializes the object with the persons and times arrays.
int q(int t) returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time t according to the mentioned rules.
