you are given a 0-indexed array nums consisiting of positive integers. you can do the following operation on the array any number of times:
select an index i such that 0 <= i < n - 1 and replace either of nums[i] or nums[i+1] with their gcd value.
return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums equal to 1. if it is impossible, return -1.
the gcd of two integers is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.
