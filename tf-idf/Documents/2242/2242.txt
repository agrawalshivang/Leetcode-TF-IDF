you are given a string s of even length. split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let a be the first half and b be the second half.
two strings are alike if they have the same number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). notice that s contains uppercase and lowercase letters.
return true if a and b are alike. otherwise, return false.
