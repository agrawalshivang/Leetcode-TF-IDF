a peak element in a 2d grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.
given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].
you may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.
you must write an algorithm that runs in o(m log(n)) or o(n log(m)) time.
