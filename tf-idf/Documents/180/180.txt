you are given a string s of length n, and an integer k. you are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s.
a subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
a subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s, where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.
for example, "bba" is repeated 2 times in the string "bababcba", because the string "bbabba", constructed by concatenating "bba" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string "bababcba".
return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. if multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. if there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.
