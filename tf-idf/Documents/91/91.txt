you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. in one operation, you can:
choose two different indices i and j such that 0 <= i, j < nums.length.
choose a non-negative integer k such that the kth bit (0-indexed) in the binary representation of nums[i] and nums[j] is 1.
subtract 2k from nums[i] and nums[j].
a subarray is beautiful if it is possible to make all of its elements equal to 0 after applying the above operation any number of times.
return the number of beautiful subarrays in the array nums.
a subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
