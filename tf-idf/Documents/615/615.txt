you are given a 0-indexed circular string array words and a string target. a circular array means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.
formally, the next element of words[i] is words[(i + 1) % n] and the previous element of words[i] is words[(i - 1 + n) % n], where n is the length of words.
starting from startindex, you can move to either the next word or the previous word with 1 step at a time.
return the shortest distance needed to reach the string target. if the string target does not exist in words, return -1.
