you are given two strings, word1 and word2. you want to construct a string in the following manner:
choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence1 from word1.
choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence2 from word2.
concatenate the subsequences: subsequence1 + subsequence2, to make the string.
return the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed in the described manner. if no palindromes can be constructed, return 0.
a subsequence of a string s is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from s without changing the order of the remaining characters.
a palindrome is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.
