you are given an array nums of n positive integers.
you can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:
if the element is even, divide it by 2.
for example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be [1,2,3,2].
if the element is odd, multiply it by 2.
for example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be [2,2,3,4].
the deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.
return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.
