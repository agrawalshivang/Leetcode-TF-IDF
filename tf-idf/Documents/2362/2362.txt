in this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
you are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. the added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. the graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. if there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.
