the string "paypalishiring" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
p   a   h   n
a p l s i i g
y   i   r
and then read line by line: "pahnaplsiigyir"
write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
string convert(string s, int numrows);
