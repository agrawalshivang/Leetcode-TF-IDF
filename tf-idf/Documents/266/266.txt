given a string word, return the sum of the number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') in every substring of word.
a substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.
note: due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit integer. please be careful during the calculations.
