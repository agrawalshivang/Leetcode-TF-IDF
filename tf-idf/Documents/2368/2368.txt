you are given a string of digits num, such as "123456579". we can split it into a fibonacci-like sequence [123, 456, 579].
formally, a fibonacci-like sequence is a list f of non-negative integers such that:
0 <= f[i] < 231, (that is, each integer fits in a 32-bit signed integer type),
f.length >= 3, and
f[i] + f[i + 1] == f[i + 2] for all 0 <= i < f.length - 2.
note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.
return any fibonacci-like sequence split from num, or return [] if it cannot be done.
