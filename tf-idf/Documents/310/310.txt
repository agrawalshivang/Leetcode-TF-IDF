there is an n x n 0-indexed grid with some artifacts buried in it. you are given the integer n and a 0-indexed 2d integer array artifacts describing the positions of the rectangular artifacts where artifacts[i] = [r1i, c1i, r2i, c2i] denotes that the ith artifact is buried in the subgrid where:
(r1i, c1i) is the coordinate of the top-left cell of the ith artifact and
(r2i, c2i) is the coordinate of the bottom-right cell of the ith artifact.
you will excavate some cells of the grid and remove all the mud from them. if the cell has a part of an artifact buried underneath, it will be uncovered. if all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, you can extract it.
given a 0-indexed 2d integer array dig where dig[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that you will excavate the cell (ri, ci), return the number of artifacts that you can extract.
the test cases are generated such that:
no two artifacts overlap.
each artifact only covers at most 4 cells.
the entries of dig are unique.
