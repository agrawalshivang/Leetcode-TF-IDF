you are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. you are also given an array queries of size m.
you have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the ith query you do the following:
remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. it is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.
return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.
note:
the queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
the height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.
