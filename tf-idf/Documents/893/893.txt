you are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n.
the distinct difference array of nums is an array diff of length n such that diff[i] is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1] subtracted from the number of distinct elements in the prefix nums[0, ..., i].
return the distinct difference array of nums.
note that nums[i, ..., j] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index i and ending at index j inclusive. particularly, if i > j then nums[i, ..., j] denotes an empty subarray.
