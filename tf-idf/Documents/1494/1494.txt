return the number of permutations of 1 to n so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.)
(recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)
since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
