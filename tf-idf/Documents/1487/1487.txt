given an integer array nums with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. you can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.
implement the solution class:
solution(int[] nums) initializes the object with the array nums.
int pick(int target) picks a random index i from nums where nums[i] == target. if there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning.
