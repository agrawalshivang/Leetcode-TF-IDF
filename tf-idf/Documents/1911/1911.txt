you are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:
if the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. a total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.
if the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. a total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.
return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.
