there is a 2d grid of size n x n where each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially turned off.
you are given a 2d array of lamp positions lamps, where lamps[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that the lamp at grid[rowi][coli] is turned on. even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.
when a lamp is turned on, it illuminates its cell and all other cells in the same row, column, or diagonal.
you are also given another 2d array queries, where queries[j] = [rowj, colj]. for the jth query, determine whether grid[rowj][colj] is illuminated or not. after answering the jth query, turn off the lamp at grid[rowj][colj] and its 8 adjacent lamps if they exist. a lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with grid[rowj][colj].
return an array of integers ans, where ans[j] should be 1 if the cell in the jth query was illuminated, or 0 if the lamp was not.
