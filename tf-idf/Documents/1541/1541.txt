there is an integer array nums that consists of n unique elements, but you have forgotten it. however, you do remember every pair of adjacent elements in nums.
you are given a 2d integer array adjacentpairs of size n - 1 where each adjacentpairs[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that the elements ui and vi are adjacent in nums.
it is guaranteed that every adjacent pair of elements nums[i] and nums[i+1] will exist in adjacentpairs, either as [nums[i], nums[i+1]] or [nums[i+1], nums[i]]. the pairs can appear in any order.
return the original array nums. if there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
