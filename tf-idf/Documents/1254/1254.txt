you are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes a, b, and c respectively. each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. the game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).
given three integers a, b, and c, return the maximum score you can get.
