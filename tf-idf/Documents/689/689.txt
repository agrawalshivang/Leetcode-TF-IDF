you have n tasks and m workers. each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. the strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).
additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength. you can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.
given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.
