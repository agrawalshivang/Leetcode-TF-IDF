you are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. you are initially positioned at nums[0].
each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. in other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:
0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. the test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].
