given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetsum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetsum. each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.
a root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. a leaf is a node with no children.
