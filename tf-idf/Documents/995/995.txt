you are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.
the array arr is called k-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.
for example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is k-increasing for k = 2 because:
arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)
arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)
however, the same arr is not k-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).
in one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.
return the minimum number of operations required to make the array k-increasing for the given k.
