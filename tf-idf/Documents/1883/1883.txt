you have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. you are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.
return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. you may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
