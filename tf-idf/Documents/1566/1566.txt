you are given two non-negative integers num1 and num2.
in one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 from num1, otherwise subtract num1 from num2.
for example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 4, subtract num2 from num1, thus obtaining num1 = 1 and num2 = 4. however, if num1 = 4 and num2 = 5, after one operation, num1 = 4 and num2 = 1.
return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.
