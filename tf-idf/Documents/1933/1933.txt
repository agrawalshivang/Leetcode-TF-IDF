no-zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.
given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:
a and b are no-zero integers.
a + b = n
the test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. if there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.
