a string is beautiful if:
it consists of the first k letters of the english lowercase alphabet.
it does not contain any substring of length 2 or more which is a palindrome.
you are given a beautiful string s of length n and a positive integer k.
return the lexicographically smallest string of length n, which is larger than s and is beautiful. if there is no such string, return an empty string.
a string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b.
for example, "abcd" is lexicographically larger than "abcc" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.
