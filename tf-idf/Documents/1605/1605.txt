there is a hidden integer array arr that consists of n non-negative integers.
it was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = arr[i] xor arr[i + 1]. for example, if arr = [1,0,2,1], then encoded = [1,2,3].
you are given the encoded array. you are also given an integer first, that is the first element of arr, i.e. arr[0].
return the original array arr. it can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.
