we can use run-length encoding (i.e., rle) to encode a sequence of integers. in a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence.
for example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are also valid rle of arr.
given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.
implement the rleiterator class:
rleiterator(int[] encoded) initializes the object with the encoded array encoded.
int next(int n) exhausts the next n elements and returns the last element exhausted in this way. if there is no element left to exhaust, return -1 instead.
