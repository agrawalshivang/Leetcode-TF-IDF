you are given an encoded string s. to decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:
if the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
if the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total.
given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.
