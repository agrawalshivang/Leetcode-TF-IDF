we have an array of integers, nums, and an array of requests where requests[i] = [starti, endi]. the ith request asks for the sum of nums[starti] + nums[starti + 1] + ... + nums[endi - 1] + nums[endi]. both starti and endi are 0-indexed.
return the maximum total sum of all requests among all permutations of nums.
since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
