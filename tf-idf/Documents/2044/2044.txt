you are given a sorted integer array arr containing 1 and prime numbers, where all the integers of arr are unique. you are also given an integer k.
for every i and j where 0 <= i < j < arr.length, we consider the fraction arr[i] / arr[j].
return the kth smallest fraction considered. return your answer as an array of integers of size 2, where answer[0] == arr[i] and answer[1] == arr[j].
