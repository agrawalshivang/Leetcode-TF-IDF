given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.
a game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]). in each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. the game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.
return the integer which will win the game.
it is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.
