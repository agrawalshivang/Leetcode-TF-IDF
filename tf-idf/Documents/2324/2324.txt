you are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase english letters, where each letter in s appears exactly twice. you are also given a 0-indexed integer array distance of length 26.
each letter in the alphabet is numbered from 0 to 25 (i.e. 'a' -> 0, 'b' -> 1, 'c' -> 2, ... , 'z' -> 25).
in a well-spaced string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the ith letter is distance[i]. if the ith letter does not appear in s, then distance[i] can be ignored.
return true if s is a well-spaced string, otherwise return false.
