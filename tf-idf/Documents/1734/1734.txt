there is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of batchsize. they have a rule where they must serve all of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. you are given an integer batchsize and an integer array groups, where groups[i] denotes that there is a group of groups[i] customers that will visit the shop. each customer will get exactly one donut.
when a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before serving any of the following groups. a group will be happy if they all get fresh donuts. that is, the first customer of the group does not receive a donut that was left over from the previous group.
you can freely rearrange the ordering of the groups. return the maximum possible number of happy groups after rearranging the groups.
