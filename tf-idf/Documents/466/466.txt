you are given a m x n matrix grid. initially, you are located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and in each step, you can only move right or down in the matrix.
among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) and ending in the bottom-right corner (m - 1, n - 1), find the path with the maximum non-negative product. the product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.
return the maximum non-negative product modulo 109 + 7. if the maximum product is negative, return -1.
notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.
