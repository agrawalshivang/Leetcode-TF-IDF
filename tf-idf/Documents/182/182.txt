you are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a directed acyclic graph (dag). the nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).
you are also given a 2d integer array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from fromi to toi in the graph.
return a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.
a node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.
