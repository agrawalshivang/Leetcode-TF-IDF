you are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. you are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
we will send a signal from a given node k. return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. if it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.
