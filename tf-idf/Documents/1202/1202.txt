there is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. the garden starts at the point 0 and ends at the point n. (i.e the length of the garden is n).
there are n + 1 taps located at points [0, 1, ..., n] in the garden.
given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area [i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]] if it was open.
return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, if the garden cannot be watered return -1.
