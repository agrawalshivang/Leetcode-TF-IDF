sql schema
table: products
+-------------+---------+
| column name | type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store1      | int     |
| store2      | int     |
| store3      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
each row in this table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores: store1, store2, and store3.
if the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.
write an sql query to rearrange the products table so that each row has (product_id, store, price). if a product is not available in a store, do not include a row with that product_id and store combination in the result table.
return the result table in any order.
the query result format is in the following example.
