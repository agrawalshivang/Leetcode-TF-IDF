you are given an integer array nums of length n which represents a permutation of all the integers in the range [0, n - 1].
the number of global inversions is the number of the different pairs (i, j) where:
0 <= i < j < n
nums[i] > nums[j]
the number of local inversions is the number of indices i where:
0 <= i < n - 1
nums[i] > nums[i + 1]
return true if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.
