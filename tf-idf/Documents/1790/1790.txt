given an array of integers cost and an integer target, return the maximum integer you can paint under the following rules:
the cost of painting a digit (i + 1) is given by cost[i] (0-indexed).
the total cost used must be equal to target.
the integer does not have 0 digits.
since the answer may be very large, return it as a string. if there is no way to paint any integer given the condition, return "0".
