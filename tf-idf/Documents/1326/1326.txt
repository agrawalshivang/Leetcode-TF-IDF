given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a 0-indexed integer array answer where:
answer.length == nums.length.
answer[i] = |leftsum[i] - rightsum[i]|.
where:
leftsum[i] is the sum of elements to the left of the index i in the array nums. if there is no such element, leftsum[i] = 0.
rightsum[i] is the sum of elements to the right of the index i in the array nums. if there is no such element, rightsum[i] = 0.
return the array answer.
