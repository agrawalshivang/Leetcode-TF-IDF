employee_id is the primary key for this table.
this table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the id of their manager. some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null).
write an sql query to report the ids of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. when a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.
return the result table ordered by employee_id.
the query result format is in the following example.
