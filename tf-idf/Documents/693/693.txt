a 0-indexed array derived with length n is derived by computing the bitwise xor (⊕) of adjacent values in a binary array original of length n.
specifically, for each index i in the range [0, n - 1]:
if i = n - 1, then derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[0].
otherwise, derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[i + 1].
given an array derived, your task is to determine whether there exists a valid binary array original that could have formed derived.
return true if such an array exists or false otherwise.
a binary array is an array containing only 0's and 1's
