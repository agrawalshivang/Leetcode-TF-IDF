given an integer n and an integer array rounds. we have a circular track which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. a marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. the ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]. for example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]
return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.
notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (see the first example).
