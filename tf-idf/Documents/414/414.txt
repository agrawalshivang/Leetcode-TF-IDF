alice and bob take turns playing a game, with alice starting first.
initially, there are n stones in a pile. on each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.
also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.
given a positive integer n, return true if and only if alice wins the game otherwise return false, assuming both players play optimally.
