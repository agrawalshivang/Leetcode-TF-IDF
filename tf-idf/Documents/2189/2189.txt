there is an undirected weighted connected graph. you are given a positive integer n which denotes that the graph has n nodes labeled from 1 to n, and an array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti] denotes that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi with weight equal to weighti.
a path from node start to node end is a sequence of nodes [z0, z1, z2, ..., zk] such that z0 = start and zk = end and there is an edge between zi and zi+1 where 0 <= i <= k-1.
the distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. let distancetolastnode(x) denote the shortest distance of a path between node n and node x. a restricted path is a path that also satisfies that distancetolastnode(zi) > distancetolastnode(zi+1) where 0 <= i <= k-1.
return the number of restricted paths from node 1 to node n. since that number may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
