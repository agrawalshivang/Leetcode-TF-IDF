you are given a string s formed by digits and '#'. we want to map s to english lowercase characters as follows:
characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively.
return the string formed after mapping.
the test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.
