this table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
the position column has a value from 1 to 500.
the rating column has a value from 1 to 5. query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.

the percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
write an sql query to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
return the result table in any order.
