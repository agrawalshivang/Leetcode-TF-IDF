there are two mice and n different types of cheese, each type of cheese should be eaten by exactly one mouse.
a point of the cheese with index i (0-indexed) is:
reward1[i] if the first mouse eats it.
reward2[i] if the second mouse eats it.
you are given a positive integer array reward1, a positive integer array reward2, and a non-negative integer k.
return the maximum points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats exactly k types of cheese.
