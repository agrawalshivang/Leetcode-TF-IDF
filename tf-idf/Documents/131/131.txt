given an m x n matrix, return a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is the rank of matrix[row][col].
the rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. it is calculated using the following rules:
the rank is an integer starting from 1.
if two elements p and q are in the same row or column, then:
if p < q then rank(p) < rank(q)
if p == q then rank(p) == rank(q)
if p > q then rank(p) > rank(q)
the rank should be as small as possible.
the test cases are generated so that answer is unique under the given rules.
