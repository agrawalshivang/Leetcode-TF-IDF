you are given a stream of n videos, each represented by a distinct number from 1 to n that you need to "upload" to a server. you need to implement a data structure that calculates the length of the longest uploaded prefix at various points in the upload process.
we consider i to be an uploaded prefix if all videos in the range 1 to i (inclusive) have been uploaded to the server. the longest uploaded prefix is the maximum value of i that satisfies this definition.

implement the luprefix class:
luprefix(int n) initializes the object for a stream of n videos.
void upload(int video) uploads video to the server.
int longest() returns the length of the longest uploaded prefix defined above.
