you are given a 2d integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] describes the ith interval starting at lefti and ending at righti (inclusive). the size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally righti - lefti + 1.
you are also given an integer array queries. the answer to the jth query is the size of the smallest interval i such that lefti <= queries[j] <= righti. if no such interval exists, the answer is -1.
return an array containing the answers to the queries.
