you are given a string s consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and an integer k.
a partition of a string s is called good if:
each digit of s is part of exactly one substring.
the value of each substring is less than or equal to k.
return the minimum number of substrings in a good partition of s. if no good partition of s exists, return -1.
note that:
the value of a string is its result when interpreted as an integer. for example, the value of "123" is 123 and the value of "1" is 1.
a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
