you are given a very large integer n, represented as a string, and an integer digit x. the digits in n and the digit x are in the inclusive range [1, 9], and n may represent a negative number.
you want to maximize n's numerical value by inserting x anywhere in the decimal representation of n. you cannot insert x to the left of the negative sign.
for example, if n = 73 and x = 6, it would be best to insert it between 7 and 3, making n = 763.
if n = -55 and x = 2, it would be best to insert it before the first 5, making n = -255.
return a string representing the maximum value of n after the insertion.
