an n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a '/', '\', or blank space ' '. these characters divide the square into contiguous regions.
given the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions.
note that backslash characters are escaped, so a '\' is represented as '\\'.
