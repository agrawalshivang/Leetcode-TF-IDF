given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.
swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].
for example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".
