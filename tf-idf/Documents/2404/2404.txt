you have n jobs and m workers. you are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:
difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).
every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.
for example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. if a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.
return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.
