suppose you are given the following code:
class foobar {
public void foo() {
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
print("foo");
}
}

public void bar() {
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
print("bar");
}
}
}
the same instance of foobar will be passed to two different threads:
thread a will call foo(), while
thread b will call bar().
modify the given program to output "foobar" n times.
