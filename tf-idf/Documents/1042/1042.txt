you are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers tasks, representing tasks that need to be completed in order, where tasks[i] represents the type of the ith task.
you are also given a positive integer space, which represents the minimum number of days that must pass after the completion of a task before another task of the same type can be performed.
each day, until all tasks have been completed, you must either:
complete the next task from tasks, or
take a break.
return the minimum number of days needed to complete all tasks.
