given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (list[node]) of its neighbors.
class node {
public int val;
public list<node> neighbors;
}
test case format:
for simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). for example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. the graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
an adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
the given node will always be the first node with val = 1. you must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
