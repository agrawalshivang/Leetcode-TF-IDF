you are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxcost.
you want to change s to t. changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ascii values of the characters).
return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxcost. if there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.
