you are given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. you computed the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays from the array and then sorted them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2 numbers.
return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in the new array. since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 109 + 7.
