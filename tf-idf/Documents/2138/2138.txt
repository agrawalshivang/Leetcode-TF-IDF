there are a total of numcourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numcourses - 1. you are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course ai first if you want to take course bi.
for example, the pair [0, 1] indicates that you have to take course 0 before you can take course 1.
prerequisites can also be indirect. if course a is a prerequisite of course b, and course b is a prerequisite of course c, then course a is a prerequisite of course c.
you are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [uj, vj]. for the jth query, you should answer whether course uj is a prerequisite of course vj or not.
return a boolean array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.
