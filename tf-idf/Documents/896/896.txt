there are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. each person is labeled with a unique id from 0 to n - 1.
you are given an integer array groupsizes, where groupsizes[i] is the size of the group that person i is in. for example, if groupsizes[1] = 3, then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.
return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupsizes[i].
each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. if there are multiple answers, return any of them. it is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.
