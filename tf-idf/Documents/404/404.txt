given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.
note that:
a subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
a sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).
