a string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.
given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.
the frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. for example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.
