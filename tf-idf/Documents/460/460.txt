a sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. each word consists of lowercase and uppercase english letters.
a sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.
for example, the sentence "this is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 this1" or "is2 sentence4 this1 a3".
given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.
