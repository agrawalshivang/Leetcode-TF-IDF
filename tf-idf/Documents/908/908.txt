given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. each node must have the same probability of being chosen.
implement the solution class:
solution(listnode head) initializes the object with the head of the singly-linked list head.
int getrandom() chooses a node randomly from the list and returns its value. all the nodes of the list should be equally likely to be chosen.
