there exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. you are given a positive integer n, indicating that you must do the following routine for n minutes:
at the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.
every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.
below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.
