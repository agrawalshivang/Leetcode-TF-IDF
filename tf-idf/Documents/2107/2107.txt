create a class arraywrapper that accepts an array of integers in it's constructor. this class should have two features:
when two instances of this class are added together with the + operator, the resulting value is the sum of all the elements in both arrays.
when the string() function is called on the instance, it will return a comma separated string surrounded by brackets. for example, [1,2,3].
