you are working in a ball factory where you have n balls numbered from lowlimit up to highlimit inclusive (i.e., n == highlimit - lowlimit + 1), and an infinite number of boxes numbered from 1 to infinity.
your job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number. for example, the ball number 321 will be put in the box number 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 and the ball number 10 will be put in the box number 1 + 0 = 1.
given two integers lowlimit and highlimit, return the number of balls in the box with the most balls.
