given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:
change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.
return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.
