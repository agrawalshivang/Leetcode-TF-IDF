items[i] = [valuei, weighti] where valuei represents the value and weighti represents the weight of the ith item.
the value of each item in items is unique.
return a 2d integer array ret where ret[i] = [valuei, weighti], with weighti being the sum of weights of all items with value valuei.
note: ret should be returned in ascending order by value.
