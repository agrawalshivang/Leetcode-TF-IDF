you are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums. find the number of triplets (i, j, k) that meet the following conditions:
0 <= i < j < k < nums.length
nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k] are pairwise distinct.
in other words, nums[i] != nums[j], nums[i] != nums[k], and nums[j] != nums[k].
return the number of triplets that meet the conditions.
