you are given two lists of closed intervals, firstlist and secondlist, where firstlist[i] = [starti, endi] and secondlist[j] = [startj, endj]. each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.
return the intersection of these two interval lists.
a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.
the intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. for example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].
