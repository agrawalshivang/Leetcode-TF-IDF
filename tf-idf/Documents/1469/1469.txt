a die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. you introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than rollmax[i] (1-indexed) consecutive times.
given an array of integers rollmax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls. since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.
