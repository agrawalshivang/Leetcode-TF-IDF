there is a country of n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. in this country, there is a road connecting every pair of cities.
there are m friends numbered from 0 to m - 1 who are traveling through the country. each one of them will take a path consisting of some cities. each path is represented by an integer array that contains the visited cities in order. the path may contain a city more than once, but the same city will not be listed consecutively.
given an integer n and a 2d integer array paths where paths[i] is an integer array representing the path of the ith friend, return the length of the longest common subpath that is shared by every friend's path, or 0 if there is no common subpath at all.
a subpath of a path is a contiguous sequence of cities within that path.
