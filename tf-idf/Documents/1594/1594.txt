there is a row of m houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the n colors (labeled from 1 to n), some houses that have been painted last summer should not be painted again.
a neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.
for example: houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1] contains 5 neighborhoods [{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2}, {1,1}].
given an array houses, an m x n matrix cost and an integer target where:
houses[i]: is the color of the house i, and 0 if the house is not painted yet.
cost[i][j]: is the cost of paint the house i with the color j + 1.
return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly target neighborhoods. if it is not possible, return -1.
