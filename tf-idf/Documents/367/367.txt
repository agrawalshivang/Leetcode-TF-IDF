a parentheses string is a non-empty string consisting only of '(' and ')'. it is valid if any of the following conditions is true:
it is ().
it can be written as ab (a concatenated with b), where a and b are valid parentheses strings.
it can be written as (a), where a is a valid parentheses string.
you are given a parentheses string s and a string locked, both of length n. locked is a binary string consisting only of '0's and '1's. for each index i of locked,
if locked[i] is '1', you cannot change s[i].
but if locked[i] is '0', you can change s[i] to either '(' or ')'.
return true if you can make s a valid parentheses string. otherwise, return false.
