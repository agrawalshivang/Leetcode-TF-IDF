you are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1d) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. you are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2d) array with  m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.
the elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2d array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2d array, and so on.
return an m x n 2d array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2d array if it is impossible.
