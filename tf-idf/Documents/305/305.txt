you are given two strings stamp and target. initially, there is a string s of length target.length with all s[i] == '?'.
in one turn, you can place stamp over s and replace every letter in the s with the corresponding letter from stamp.
for example, if stamp = "abc" and target = "abcba", then s is "?????" initially. in one turn you can:
place stamp at index 0 of s to obtain "abc??",
place stamp at index 1 of s to obtain "?abc?", or
place stamp at index 2 of s to obtain "??abc".
note that stamp must be fully contained in the boundaries of s in order to stamp (i.e., you cannot place stamp at index 3 of s).
we want to convert s to target using at most 10 * target.length turns.
return an array of the index of the left-most letter being stamped at each turn. if we cannot obtain target from s within 10 * target.length turns, return an empty array.
