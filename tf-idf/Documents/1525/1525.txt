you are given two strings order and s. all the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.
permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. more specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.
return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.
