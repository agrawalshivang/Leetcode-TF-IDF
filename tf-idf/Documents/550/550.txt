email address:
an email address is:
a name consisting of uppercase and lowercase english letters, followed by
the '@' symbol, followed by
the domain consisting of uppercase and lowercase english letters with a dot '.' somewhere in the middle (not the first or last character).

the middle letters of the name (i.e., all but the first and last letters) must be replaced by 5 asterisks "*****".
phone number:
a phone number is formatted as follows:
the phone number contains 10-13 digits.
the last 10 digits make up the local number.
the remaining 0-3 digits, in the beginning, make up the country code.
separation characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '} separate the above digits in some way.
to mask a phone number:
remove all separation characters.
the masked phone number should have the form:
"***-***-xxxx" if the country code has 0 digits.
"+*-***-***-xxxx" if the country code has 1 digit.
"+**-***-***-xxxx" if the country code has 2 digits.
"+***-***-***-xxxx" if the country code has 3 digits.
"xxxx" is the last 4 digits of the local number.
