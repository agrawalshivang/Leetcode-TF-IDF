given an array of integers arr.
we want to select three indices i, j and k where (0 <= i < j <= k < arr.length).
let's define a and b as follows:
a = arr[i] ^ arr[i + 1] ^ ... ^ arr[j - 1]
b = arr[j] ^ arr[j + 1] ^ ... ^ arr[k]
note that ^ denotes the bitwise-xor operation.
return the number of triplets (i, j and k) where a == b.
