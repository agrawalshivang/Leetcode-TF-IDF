you have a 1-indexed binary string of length n where all the bits are 0 initially. we will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from 0 to 1) one by one. you are given a 1-indexed integer array flips where flips[i] indicates that the bit at index i will be flipped in the ith step.
a binary string is prefix-aligned if, after the ith step, all the bits in the inclusive range [1, i] are ones and all the other bits are zeros.
return the number of times the binary string is prefix-aligned during the flipping process.
