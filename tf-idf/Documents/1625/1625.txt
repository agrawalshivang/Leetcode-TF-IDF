there is a stream of n (idkey, value) pairs arriving in an arbitrary order, where idkey is an integer between 1 and n and value is a string. no two pairs have the same id.
design a stream that returns the values in increasing order of their ids by returning a chunk (list) of values after each insertion. the concatenation of all the chunks should result in a list of the sorted values.
implement the orderedstream class:
orderedstream(int n) constructs the stream to take n values.
string[] insert(int idkey, string value) inserts the pair (idkey, value) into the stream, then returns the largest possible chunk of currently inserted values that appear next in the order.
