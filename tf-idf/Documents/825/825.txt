there are two types of persons:
the good person: the person who always tells the truth.
the bad person: the person who might tell the truth and might lie.
you are given a 0-indexed 2d integer array statements of size n x n that represents the statements made by n people about each other. more specifically, statements[i][j] could be one of the following:
0 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a bad person.
1 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a good person.
2 represents that no statement is made by person i about person j.
additionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. formally, we have that statements[i][i] = 2 for all 0 <= i < n.
return the maximum number of people who can be good based on the statements made by the n people.
