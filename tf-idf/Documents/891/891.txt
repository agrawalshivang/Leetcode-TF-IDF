in the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. the player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.
what if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?
for example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.
given two integers maxchoosableinteger and desiredtotal, return true if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return false. assume both players play optimally.
