you are implementing a program to use as your calendar. we can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.
a triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).
the event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
implement the mycalendartwo class:
mycalendartwo() initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
