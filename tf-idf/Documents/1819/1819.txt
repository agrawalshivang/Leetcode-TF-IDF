you have n binary tree nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 where node i has two children leftchild[i] and rightchild[i], return true if and only if all the given nodes form exactly one valid binary tree.
if node i has no left child then leftchild[i] will equal -1, similarly for the right child.
note that the nodes have no values and that we only use the node numbers in this problem.
