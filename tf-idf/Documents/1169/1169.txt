you are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
find the longest subsequence of nums that meets the following requirements:
the subsequence is strictly increasing and
the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most k.
return the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements.
a subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
