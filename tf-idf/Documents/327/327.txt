you are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.
return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.
note:
the subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
the empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
a subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
