given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.
according to wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. it can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
design an algorithm that runs in less than o(n) time complexity.
