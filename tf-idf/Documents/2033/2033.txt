given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. if the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.
an uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.
a subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.
for example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).
