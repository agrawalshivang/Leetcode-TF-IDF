your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. your car can go into negative positions. your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions 'a' (accelerate) and 'r' (reverse):
when you get an instruction 'a', your car does the following:
position += speed
speed *= 2
when you get an instruction 'r', your car does the following:
if your speed is positive then speed = -1
otherwise speed = 1
your position stays the same.
for example, after commands "aar", your car goes to positions 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3, and your speed goes to 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1.
given a target position target, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.
