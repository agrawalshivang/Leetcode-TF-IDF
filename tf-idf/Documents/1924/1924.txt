you are given an integer array nums and an integer k. you are asked to distribute this array into k subsets of equal size such that there are no two equal elements in the same subset.
a subset's incompatibility is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in that array.
return the minimum possible sum of incompatibilities of the k subsets after distributing the array optimally, or return -1 if it is not possible.
a subset is a group integers that appear in the array with no particular order.
