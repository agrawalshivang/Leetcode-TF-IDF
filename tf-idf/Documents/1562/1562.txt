given the array queries of positive integers between 1 and m, you have to process all queries[i] (from i=0 to i=queries.length-1) according to the following rules:
in the beginning, you have the permutation p=[1,2,3,...,m].
for the current i, find the position of queries[i] in the permutation p (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation p. notice that the position of queries[i] in p is the result for queries[i].
return an array containing the result for the given queries.
