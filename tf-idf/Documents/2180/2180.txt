let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!. recall that x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x and by convention, 0! = 1.
for example, f(3) = 0 because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while f(11) = 2 because 11! = 39916800 has two zeroes at the end.
given an integer k, return the number of non-negative integers x have the property that f(x) = k.
