you are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and a positive integer k. you must choose a subsequence of indices from nums1 of length k.
for chosen indices i0, i1, ..., ik - 1, your score is defined as:
the sum of the selected elements from nums1 multiplied with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.
it can defined simply as: (nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1]).
return the maximum possible score.
a subsequence of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} by deleting some or no elements.
