you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.
we call an index i in the range k <= i < n - k good if the following conditions are satisfied:
the k elements that are just before the index i are in non-increasing order.
the k elements that are just after the index i are in non-decreasing order.
return an array of all good indices sorted in increasing order.
