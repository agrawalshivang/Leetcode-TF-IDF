you have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: red, yellow, or green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).
given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. as the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.
