you are given a 0-indexed string s. you are also given a 0-indexed string querycharacters of length k and a 0-indexed array of integer indices queryindices of length k, both of which are used to describe k queries.
the ith query updates the character in s at index queryindices[i] to the character querycharacters[i].
return an array lengths of length k where lengths[i] is the length of the longest substring of s consisting of only one repeating character after the ith query is performed.
