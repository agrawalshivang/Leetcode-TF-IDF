there is an integer array perm that is a permutation of the first n positive integers, where n is always odd.
it was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = perm[i] xor perm[i + 1]. for example, if perm = [1,3,2], then encoded = [2,1].
given the encoded array, return the original array perm. it is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.
