there is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n days. on the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. on some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.
you decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). note that you can keep eating after the first n days.
given two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.
