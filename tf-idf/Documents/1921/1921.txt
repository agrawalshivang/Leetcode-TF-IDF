you are given a positive integer n, that is initially placed on a board. every day, for 109 days, you perform the following procedure:
for each number x present on the board, find all numbers 1 <= i <= n such that x % i == 1.
then, place those numbers on the board.
return the number of distinct integers present on the board after 109 days have elapsed.
note:
once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.
% stands for the modulo operation. for example, 14 % 3 is 2.
