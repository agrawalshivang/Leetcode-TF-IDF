you are given two arrays rowsum and colsum of non-negative integers where rowsum[i] is the sum of the elements in the ith row and colsum[j] is the sum of the elements of the jth column of a 2d matrix. in other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.
find any matrix of non-negative integers of size rowsum.length x colsum.length that satisfies the rowsum and colsum requirements.
return a 2d array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements. it's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.
