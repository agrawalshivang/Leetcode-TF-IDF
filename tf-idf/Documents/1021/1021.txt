you are given a 0-indexed string pattern of length n consisting of the characters 'i' meaning increasing and 'd' meaning decreasing.
a 0-indexed string num of length n + 1 is created using the following conditions:
num consists of the digits '1' to '9', where each digit is used at most once.
if pattern[i] == 'i', then num[i] < num[i + 1].
if pattern[i] == 'd', then num[i] > num[i + 1].
return the lexicographically smallest possible string num that meets the conditions.
