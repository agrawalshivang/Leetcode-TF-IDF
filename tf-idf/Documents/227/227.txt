given two strings a and b, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string a so that string b is a substring of it. if it is impossible for b to be a substring of a after repeating it, return -1.
notice: string "abc" repeated 0 times is "", repeated 1 time is "abc" and repeated 2 times is "abcabc".
