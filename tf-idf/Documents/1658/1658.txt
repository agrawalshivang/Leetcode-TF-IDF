in a project, you have a list of required skills req_skills, and a list of people. the ith person people[i] contains a list of skills that the person has.
consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in req_skills, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. we can represent these teams by the index of each person.
for example, team = [0, 1, 3] represents the people with skills people[0], people[1], and people[3].
return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person. you may return the answer in any order.
it is guaranteed an answer exists.
