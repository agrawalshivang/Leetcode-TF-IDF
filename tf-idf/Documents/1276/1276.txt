given three integers x, y, and bound, return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to bound.
an integer is powerful if it can be represented as xi + yj for some integers i >= 0 and j >= 0.
you may return the answer in any order. in your answer, each value should occur at most once.
