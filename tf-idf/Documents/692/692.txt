you are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of n positive integers.
the array nums is called alternating if:
nums[i - 2] == nums[i], where 2 <= i <= n - 1.
nums[i - 1] != nums[i], where 1 <= i <= n - 1.
in one operation, you can choose an index i and change nums[i] into any positive integer.
return the minimum number of operations required to make the array alternating.
