given a string path, where path[i] = 'n', 's', 'e' or 'w', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. you start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2d plane and walk on the path specified by path.
return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. return false otherwise.
