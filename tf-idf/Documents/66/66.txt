you are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.
a round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. in one round, do the following:
divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. for example, "346" is replaced with "13" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. if the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.
return s after all rounds have been completed.
