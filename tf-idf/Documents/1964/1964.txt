you are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. the string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. you are also given an integer k.
we want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.
return the reformatted license key.
