the width of a sequence is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sequence.
given an array of integers nums, return the sum of the widths of all the non-empty subsequences of nums. since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. for example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].
