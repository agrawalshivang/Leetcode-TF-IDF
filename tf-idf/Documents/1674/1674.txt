you are given two positive 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, both of length n.
the sum of squared difference of arrays nums1 and nums2 is defined as the sum of (nums1[i] - nums2[i])2 for each 0 <= i < n.
you are also given two positive integers k1 and k2. you can modify any of the elements of nums1 by +1 or -1 at most k1 times. similarly, you can modify any of the elements of nums2 by +1 or -1 at most k2 times.
return the minimum sum of squared difference after modifying array nums1 at most k1 times and modifying array nums2 at most k2 times.
note: you are allowed to modify the array elements to become negative integers.
