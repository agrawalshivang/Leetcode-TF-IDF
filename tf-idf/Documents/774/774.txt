you are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.
you need to implement the function pickindex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. the probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).
for example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).
