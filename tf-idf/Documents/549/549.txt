given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:
append the character '0' zero times.
append the character '1' one times.
this can be performed any number of times.
a good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).
return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
