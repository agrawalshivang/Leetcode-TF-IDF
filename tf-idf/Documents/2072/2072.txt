design a data structure to find the frequency of a given value in a given subarray.
the frequency of a value in a subarray is the number of occurrences of that value in the subarray.
implement the rangefreqquery class:
rangefreqquery(int[] arr) constructs an instance of the class with the given 0-indexed integer array arr.
int query(int left, int right, int value) returns the frequency of value in the subarray arr[left...right].
a subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array. arr[left...right] denotes the subarray that contains the elements of nums between indices left and right (inclusive).
