we define str = [s, n] as the string str which consists of the string s concatenated n times.
for example, str == ["abc", 3] =="abcabcabc".
we define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1.
for example, s1 = "abc" can be obtained from s2 = "abdbec" based on our definition by removing the bolded underlined characters.
you are given two strings s1 and s2 and two integers n1 and n2. you have the two strings str1 = [s1, n1] and str2 = [s2, n2].
return the maximum integer m such that str = [str2, m] can be obtained from str1.
