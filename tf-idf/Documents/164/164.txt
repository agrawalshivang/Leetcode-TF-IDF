you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. you have to partition the array into one or more contiguous subarrays.
we call a partition of the array valid if each of the obtained subarrays satisfies one of the following conditions:
the subarray consists of exactly 2 equal elements. for example, the subarray [2,2] is good.
the subarray consists of exactly 3 equal elements. for example, the subarray [4,4,4] is good.
the subarray consists of exactly 3 consecutive increasing elements, that is, the difference between adjacent elements is 1. for example, the subarray [3,4,5] is good, but the subarray [1,3,5] is not.
return true if the array has at least one valid partition. otherwise, return false.
