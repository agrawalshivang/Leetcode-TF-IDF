you are given the root of a binary search tree and an array queries of size n consisting of positive integers.
find a 2d array answer of size n where answer[i] = [mini, maxi]:
mini is the largest value in the tree that is smaller than or equal to queries[i]. if a such value does not exist, add -1 instead.
maxi is the smallest value in the tree that is greater than or equal to queries[i]. if a such value does not exist, add -1 instead.
return the array answer.
