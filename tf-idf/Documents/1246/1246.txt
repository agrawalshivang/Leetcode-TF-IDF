you are given two strings word1 and word2. you want to construct a string merge in the following way: while either word1 or word2 are non-empty, choose one of the following options:
if word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.
for example, if word1 = "abc" and merge = "dv", then after choosing this operation, word1 = "bc" and merge = "dva".
if word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.
for example, if word2 = "abc" and merge = "", then after choosing this operation, word2 = "bc" and merge = "a".
return the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.
a string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. for example, "abcd" is lexicographically larger than "abcc" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.
