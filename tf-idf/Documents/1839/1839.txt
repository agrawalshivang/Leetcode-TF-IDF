you are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.
we are playing a game with the stones. on each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. the result of this smash is:
if x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
if x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
at the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
return the weight of the last remaining stone. if there are no stones left, return 0.
