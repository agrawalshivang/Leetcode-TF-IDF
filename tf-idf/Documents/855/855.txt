assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. but, you should give each child at most one cookie.
each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. if s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
