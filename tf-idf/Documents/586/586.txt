you are given an integer array nums (0-indexed). in one operation, you can choose an element of the array and increment it by 1.
for example, if nums = [1,2,3], you can choose to increment nums[1] to make nums = [1,3,3].
return the minimum number of operations needed to make nums strictly increasing.
an array nums is strictly increasing if nums[i] < nums[i+1] for all 0 <= i < nums.length - 1. an array of length 1 is trivially strictly increasing.
