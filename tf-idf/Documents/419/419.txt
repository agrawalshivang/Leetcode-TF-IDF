given an integer array nums and two integers firstlen and secondlen, return the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays with lengths firstlen and secondlen.
the array with length firstlen could occur before or after the array with length secondlen, but they have to be non-overlapping.
a subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
