you are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. in a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.
return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.
a string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.
a string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.
