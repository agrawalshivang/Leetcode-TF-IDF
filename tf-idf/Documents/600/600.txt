you are given the logs for users' actions on leetcode, and an integer k. the logs are represented by a 2d integer array logs where each logs[i] = [idi, timei] indicates that the user with idi performed an action at the minute timei.
multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.
the user active minutes (uam) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on leetcode. a minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.
you are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of users whose uam equals j.
return the array answer as described above.
