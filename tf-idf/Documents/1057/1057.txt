you are given an undirected graph. you are given an integer n which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between ui and vi.
a connected trio is a set of three nodes where there is an edge between every pair of them.
the degree of a connected trio is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.
return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the graph has no connected trios.
