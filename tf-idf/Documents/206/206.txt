a permutation perm of n + 1 integers of all the integers in the range [0, n] can be represented as a string s of length n where:
s[i] == 'i' if perm[i] < perm[i + 1], and
s[i] == 'd' if perm[i] > perm[i + 1].
given a string s, reconstruct the permutation perm and return it. if there are multiple valid permutations perm, return any of them.
