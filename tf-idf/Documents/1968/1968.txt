design an algorithm that accepts a stream of integers and retrieves the product of the last k integers of the stream.
implement the productofnumbers class:
productofnumbers() initializes the object with an empty stream.
void add(int num) appends the integer num to the stream.
int getproduct(int k) returns the product of the last k numbers in the current list. you can assume that always the current list has at least k numbers.
the test cases are generated so that, at any time, the product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit into a single 32-bit integer without overflowing.
