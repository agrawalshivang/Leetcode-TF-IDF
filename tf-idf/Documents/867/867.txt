serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. there is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. you need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
the encoded string should be as compact as possible.
