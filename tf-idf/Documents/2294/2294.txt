a binary tree is named even-odd if it meets the following conditions:
the root of the binary tree is at level index 0, its children are at level index 1, their children are at level index 2, etc.
for every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).
for every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).
given the root of a binary tree, return true if the binary tree is even-odd, otherwise return false.
