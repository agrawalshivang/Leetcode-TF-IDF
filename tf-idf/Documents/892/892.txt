given an array of integers preorder, which represents the preorder traversal of a bst (i.e., binary search tree), construct the tree and return its root.
it is guaranteed that there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements for the given test cases.
a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of node.left has a value strictly less than node.val, and any descendant of node.right has a value strictly greater than node.val.
a preorder traversal of a binary tree displays the value of the node first, then traverses node.left, then traverses node.right.
