you are given a string s, and an array of pairs of indices in the string pairs where pairs[i] = [a, b] indicates 2 indices(0-indexed) of the string.
you can swap the characters at any pair of indices in the given pairs any number of times.
return the lexicographically smallest string that s can be changed to after using the swaps.
