serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. there is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. you just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
clarification: the input/output format is the same as how leetcode serializes a binary tree. you do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
