a magical string s consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:
the string s is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string s itself.
the first few elements of s is s = "1221121221221121122……". if we group the consecutive 1's and 2's in s, it will be "1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......" and the occurrences of 1's or 2's in each group are "1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......". you can see that the occurrence sequence is s itself.
given an integer n, return the number of 1's in the first n number in the magical string s.
