you are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.
the strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.
for example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as follows:
abc
bce
cae
you want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. in the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted, while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.
return the number of columns that you will delete.
