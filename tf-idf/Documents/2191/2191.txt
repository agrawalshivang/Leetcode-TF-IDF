on an alphabet board, we start at position (0, 0), corresponding to character board[0][0].
here, board = ["abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z"], as shown in the diagram below.
we may make the following moves:
'u' moves our position up one row, if the position exists on the board;
'd' moves our position down one row, if the position exists on the board;
'l' moves our position left one column, if the position exists on the board;
'r' moves our position right one column, if the position exists on the board;
'!' adds the character board[r][c] at our current position (r, c) to the answer.
(here, the only positions that exist on the board are positions with letters on them.)
return a sequence of moves that makes our answer equal to target in the minimum number of moves.  you may return any path that does so.
