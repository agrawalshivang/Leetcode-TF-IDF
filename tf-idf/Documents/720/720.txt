a binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0's (possibly none), followed by some number of 1's (also possibly none).
you are given a binary string s. you can flip s[i] changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.
return the minimum number of flips to make s monotone increasing.
