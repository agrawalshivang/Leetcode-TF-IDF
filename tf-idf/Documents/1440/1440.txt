you are given a rectangular cake of size h x w and two arrays of integers horizontalcuts and verticalcuts where:
horizontalcuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and similarly, and
verticalcuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.
return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalcuts and verticalcuts. since the answer can be a large number, return this modulo 109 + 7.
