given two positive integers num1 and num2, find the positive integer x such that:
x has the same number of set bits as num2, and
the value x xor num1 is minimal.
note that xor is the bitwise xor operation.
return the integer x. the test cases are generated such that x is uniquely determined.
the number of set bits of an integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation.
