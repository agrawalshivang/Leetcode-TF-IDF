you are given a 0-indexed string s that has lowercase english letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices.
there is a function shift(c, x), where c is a character and x is a digit, that returns the xth character after c.
for example, shift('a', 5) = 'f' and shift('x', 0) = 'x'.
for every odd index i, you want to replace the digit s[i] with shift(s[i-1], s[i]).
return s after replacing all digits. it is guaranteed that shift(s[i-1], s[i]) will never exceed 'z'.
