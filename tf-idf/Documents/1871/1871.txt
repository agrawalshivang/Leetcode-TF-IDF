an undirected graph of n nodes is defined by edgelist, where edgelist[i] = [ui, vi, disi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi with distance disi. note that there may be multiple edges between two nodes.
given an array queries, where queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj], your task is to determine for each queries[j] whether there is a path between pj and qj such that each edge on the path has a distance strictly less than limitj .
return a boolean array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and the jth value of answer is true if there is a path for queries[j] is true, and false otherwise.
