given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.
in one pancake flip we do the following steps:
choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.
reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).
for example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.
return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.
