you are given a string word that consists of digits and lowercase english letters.
you will replace every non-digit character with a space. for example, "a123bc34d8ef34" will become " 123  34 8  34". notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: "123", "34", "8", and "34".
return the number of different integers after performing the replacement operations on word.
two integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.
