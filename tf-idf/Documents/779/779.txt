you are given an m x n integer array grid. there is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). the robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). the robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
an obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. a path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.
return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
the testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
