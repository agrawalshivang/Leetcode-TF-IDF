you are given two string arrays words1 and words2.
a string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.
for example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".
a string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.
return an array of all the universal strings in words1. you may return the answer in any order.
