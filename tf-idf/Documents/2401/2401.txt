you are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers, and an integer k.
the k-radius average for a subarray of nums centered at some index i with the radius k is the average of all elements in nums between the indices i - k and i + k (inclusive). if there are less than k elements before or after the index i, then the k-radius average is -1.
build and return an array avgs of length n where avgs[i] is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at index i.
the average of x elements is the sum of the x elements divided by x, using integer division. the integer division truncates toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.
for example, the average of four elements 2, 3, 1, and 5 is (2 + 3 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75, which truncates to 2.
