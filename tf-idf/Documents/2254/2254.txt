for a binary tree t, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.
a binary tree x is flip equivalent to a binary tree y if and only if we can make x equal to y after some number of flip operations.
given the roots of two binary trees root1 and root2, return true if the two trees are flip equivalent or false otherwise.
