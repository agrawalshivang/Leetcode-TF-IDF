you are given an array of logs. each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.
there are two types of logs:
letter-logs: all words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase english letters.
digit-logs: all words (except the identifier) consist of digits.
reorder these logs so that:
the letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
the letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. if their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
the digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
return the final order of the logs.
