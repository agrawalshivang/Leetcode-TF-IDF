you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.
initially, all of the indices are unmarked. you are allowed to make this operation any number of times:
pick two different unmarked indices i and j such that 2 * nums[i] <= nums[j], then mark i and j.
return the maximum possible number of marked indices in nums using the above operation any number of times.
