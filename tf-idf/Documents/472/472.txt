you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer value.
in one operation, you can add or subtract value from any element of nums.
for example, if nums = [1,2,3] and value = 2, you can choose to subtract value from nums[0] to make nums = [-1,2,3].
the mex (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest missing non-negative integer in it.
for example, the mex of [-1,2,3] is 0 while the mex of [1,0,3] is 2.
return the maximum mex of nums after applying the mentioned operation any number of times.
