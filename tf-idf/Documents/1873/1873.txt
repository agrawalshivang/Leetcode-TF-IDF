given two positive integers n and k, the binary string sn is formed as follows:
s1 = "0"
si = si - 1 + "1" + reverse(invert(si - 1)) for i > 1
where + denotes the concatenation operation, reverse(x) returns the reversed string x, and invert(x) inverts all the bits in x (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0).
for example, the first four strings in the above sequence are:
s1 = "0"
s2 = "011"
s3 = "0111001"
s4 = "011100110110001"
return the kth bit in sn. it is guaranteed that k is valid for the given n.
