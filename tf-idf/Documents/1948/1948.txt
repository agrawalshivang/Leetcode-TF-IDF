you are given an integer array cards of length 4. you have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. you should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators ['+', '-', '*', '/'] and the parentheses '(' and ')' to get the value 24.
you are restricted with the following rules:
the division operator '/' represents real division, not integer division.
for example, 4 / (1 - 2 / 3) = 4 / (1 / 3) = 12.
every operation done is between two numbers. in particular, we cannot use '-' as a unary operator.
for example, if cards = [1, 1, 1, 1], the expression "-1 - 1 - 1 - 1" is not allowed.
you cannot concatenate numbers together
for example, if cards = [1, 2, 1, 2], the expression "12 + 12" is not valid.
return true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise.
