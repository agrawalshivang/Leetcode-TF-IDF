given a string of digits s, return the number of palindromic subsequences of s having length 5. since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
note:
a string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
a subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
