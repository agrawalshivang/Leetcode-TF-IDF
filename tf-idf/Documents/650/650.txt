you are given an integer array nums and two integers limit and goal. the array nums has an interesting property that abs(nums[i]) <= limit.
return the minimum number of elements you need to add to make the sum of the array equal to goal. the array must maintain its property that abs(nums[i]) <= limit.
note that abs(x) equals x if x >= 0, and -x otherwise.
