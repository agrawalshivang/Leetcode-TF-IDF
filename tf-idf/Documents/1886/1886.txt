there is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. the graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2d integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].
a node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. a node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).
return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. the answer should be sorted in ascending order.
