given an array of functions [f1, f2, f3, ..., fn], return a new function fn that is the function composition of the array of functions.
the function composition of [f(x), g(x), h(x)] is fn(x) = f(g(h(x))).
the function composition of an empty list of functions is the identity function f(x) = x.
you may assume each function in the array accepts one integer as input and returns one integer as output.
