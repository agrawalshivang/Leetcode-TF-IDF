we run a preorder depth-first search (dfs) on the root of a binary tree.
at each node in this traversal, we output d dashes (where d is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  if the depth of a node is d, the depth of its immediate child is d + 1.  the depth of the root node is 0.
if a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.
given the output traversal of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.
