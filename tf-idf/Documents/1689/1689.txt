you are given a string s that consists of the digits '1' to '9' and two integers k and minlength.
a partition of s is called beautiful if:
s is partitioned into k non-intersecting substrings.
each substring has a length of at least minlength.
each substring starts with a prime digit and ends with a non-prime digit. prime digits are '2', '3', '5', and '7', and the rest of the digits are non-prime.
return the number of beautiful partitions of s. since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
