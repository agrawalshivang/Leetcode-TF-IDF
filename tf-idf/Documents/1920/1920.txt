you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. an index i is part of a hill in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are smaller than nums[i]. similarly, an index i is part of a valley in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are larger than nums[i]. adjacent indices i and j are part of the same hill or valley if nums[i] == nums[j].
note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index.
return the number of hills and valleys in nums.
