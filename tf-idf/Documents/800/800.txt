you are given a directed graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.
the graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size n, indicating that there is a directed edge from node i to node edges[i]. if there is no outgoing edge from node i, then edges[i] == -1.
return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. if no cycle exists, return -1.
a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.
