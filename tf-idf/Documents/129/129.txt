you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.
you are initially standing at index 0. in one move, you can jump at most k steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. that is, you can jump from index i to any index in the range [i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)] inclusive.
you want to reach the last index of the array (index n - 1). your score is the sum of all nums[j] for each index j you visited in the array.
return the maximum score you can get.
