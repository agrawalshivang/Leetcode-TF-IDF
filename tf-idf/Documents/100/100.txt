an axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. its top and bottom edges are parallel to the x-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the y-axis.
two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. to be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.
given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false.
