given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which has some apples in their vertices. you spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.
the edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi. additionally, there is a boolean array hasapple, where hasapple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.
