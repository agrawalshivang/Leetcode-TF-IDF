you are given an array nums that consists of positive integers.
the gcd of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence evenly.
for example, the gcd of the sequence [4,6,16] is 2.
a subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.
for example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].
return the number of different gcds among all non-empty subsequences of nums.
