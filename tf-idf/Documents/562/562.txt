you are given an array words of size n consisting of non-empty strings.
we define the score of a string word as the number of strings words[i] such that word is a prefix of words[i].
for example, if words = ["a", "ab", "abc", "cab"], then the score of "ab" is 2, since "ab" is a prefix of both "ab" and "abc".
return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the sum of scores of every non-empty prefix of words[i].
note that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.
