you have k bags. you are given a 0-indexed integer array weights where weights[i] is the weight of the ith marble. you are also given the integer k.
divide the marbles into the k bags according to the following rules:
no bag is empty.
if the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag.
if a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].
the score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags.
return the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.
