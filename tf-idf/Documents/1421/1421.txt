you want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. jobs are dependent (i.e to work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
you have to finish at least one task every day. the difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. the difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.
you are given an integer array jobdifficulty and an integer d. the difficulty of the ith job is jobdifficulty[i].
return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. if you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.
