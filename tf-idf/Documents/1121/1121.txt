you are given an array nums of non-negative integers. nums is considered special if there exists a number x such that there are exactly x numbers in nums that are greater than or equal to x.
notice that x does not have to be an element in nums.
return x if the array is special, otherwise, return -1. it can be proven that if nums is special, the value for x is unique.
