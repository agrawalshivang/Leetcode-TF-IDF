there are n rooms you need to visit, labeled from 0 to n - 1. each day is labeled, starting from 0. you will go in and visit one room a day.
initially on day 0, you visit room 0. the order you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following rules and a given 0-indexed array nextvisit of length n:
assuming that on a day, you visit room i,
if you have been in room i an odd number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit a room with a lower or equal room number specified by nextvisit[i] where 0 <= nextvisit[i] <= i;
if you have been in room i an even number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit room (i + 1) mod n.
return the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. it can be shown that such a day exists. since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
