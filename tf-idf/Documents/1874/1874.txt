the product difference between two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) is defined as (a * b) - (c * d).
for example, the product difference between (5, 6) and (2, 7) is (5 * 6) - (2 * 7) = 16.
given an integer array nums, choose four distinct indices w, x, y, and z such that the product difference between pairs (nums[w], nums[x]) and (nums[y], nums[z]) is maximized.
return the maximum such product difference.
