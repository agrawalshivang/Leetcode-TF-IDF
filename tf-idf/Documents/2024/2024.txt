given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the x-y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
the distance between two points on the x-y plane is the euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
you may return the answer in any order. the answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
