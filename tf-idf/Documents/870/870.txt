given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
in one step you can jump from index i to index:
i + 1 where: i + 1 < arr.length.
i - 1 where: i - 1 >= 0.
j where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j.
return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.
notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
