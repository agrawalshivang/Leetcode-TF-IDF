design the combinationiterator class:
combinationiterator(string characters, int combinationlength) initializes the object with a string characters of sorted distinct lowercase english letters and a number combinationlength as arguments.
next() returns the next combination of length combinationlength in lexicographical order.
hasnext() returns true if and only if there exists a next combination.
