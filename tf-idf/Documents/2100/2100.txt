we are playing the guess game. the game is as follows:
i pick a number from 1 to n. you have to guess which number i picked.
every time you guess wrong, i will tell you whether the number i picked is higher or lower than your guess.
you call a pre-defined api int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
-1: your guess is higher than the number i picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: your guess is lower than the number i picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number i picked (i.e. num == pick).
return the number that i picked.
