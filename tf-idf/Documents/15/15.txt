there are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. the teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. after that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.
you are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. there are initially k pieces of chalk. when the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. however, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.
return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.
