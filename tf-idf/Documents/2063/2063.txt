the min-product of an array is equal to the minimum value in the array multiplied by the array's sum.
for example, the array [3,2,5] (minimum value is 2) has a min-product of 2 * (3+2+5) = 2 * 10 = 20.
given an array of integers nums, return the maximum min-product of any non-empty subarray of nums. since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
note that the min-product should be maximized before performing the modulo operation. testcases are generated such that the maximum min-product without modulo will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
a subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
