given two integers num and k, consider a set of positive integers with the following properties:
the units digit of each integer is k.
the sum of the integers is num.
return the minimum possible size of such a set, or -1 if no such set exists.
note:
the set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and the sum of an empty set is considered 0.
the units digit of a number is the rightmost digit of the number.
