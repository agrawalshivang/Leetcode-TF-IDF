you are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has two main properties: attack and defense. you are given a 2d integer array properties where properties[i] = [attacki, defensei] represents the properties of the ith character in the game.
a character is said to be weak if any other character has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense levels. more formally, a character i is said to be weak if there exists another character j where attackj > attacki and defensej > defensei.
return the number of weak characters.
