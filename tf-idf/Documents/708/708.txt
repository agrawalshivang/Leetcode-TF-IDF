given an empty set of intervals, implement a data structure that can:
add an interval to the set of intervals.
count the number of integers that are present in at least one interval.
implement the countintervals class:
countintervals() initializes the object with an empty set of intervals.
void add(int left, int right) adds the interval [left, right] to the set of intervals.
int count() returns the number of integers that are present in at least one interval.
note that an interval [left, right] denotes all the integers x where left <= x <= right.
