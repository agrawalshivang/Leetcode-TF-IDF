you are given an integer array of unique positive integers nums. consider the following graph:
there are nums.length nodes, labeled nums[0] to nums[nums.length - 1],
there is an undirected edge between nums[i] and nums[j] if nums[i] and nums[j] share a common factor greater than 1.
return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.
