given the coordinates of four points in 2d space p1, p2, p3 and p4, return true if the four points construct a square.
the coordinate of a point pi is represented as [xi, yi]. the input is not given in any order.
a valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
