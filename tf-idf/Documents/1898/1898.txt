there is a set of n items. you are given two integer arrays values and labels where the value and the label of the ith element are values[i] and labels[i] respectively. you are also given two integers numwanted and uselimit.
choose a subset s of the n elements such that:
the size of the subset s is less than or equal to numwanted.
there are at most uselimit items with the same label in s.
the score of a subset is the sum of the values in the subset.
return the maximum score of a subset s.
