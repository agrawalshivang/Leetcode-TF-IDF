you are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. you are given a 0-indexed integer array dist of size n, where dist[i] is the initial distance in kilometers of the ith monster from the city.
the monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. the speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array speed of size n, where speed[i] is the speed of the ith monster in kilometers per minute.
you have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a single monster. however, the weapon takes one minute to charge.the weapon is fully charged at the very start.
you lose when any monster reaches your city. if a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.
return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.
