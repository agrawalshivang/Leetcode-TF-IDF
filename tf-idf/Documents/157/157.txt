we are playing the guessing game. the game will work as follows:
i pick a number between 1 and n.
you guess a number.
if you guess the right number, you win the game.
if you guess the wrong number, then i will tell you whether the number i picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.
every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. if you run out of money, you lose the game.
given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number i pick.
