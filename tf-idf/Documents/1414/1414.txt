given an integer array arr and an integer k, modify the array by repeating it k times.
for example, if arr = [1, 2] and k = 3 then the modified array will be [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].
return the maximum sub-array sum in the modified array. note that the length of the sub-array can be 0 and its sum in that case is 0.
as the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 109 + 7.
