you are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened on the same day, event1 and event2, where:
event1 = [starttime1, endtime1] and
event2 = [starttime2, endtime2].
event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of hh:mm.
a conflict happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).
return true if there is a conflict between two events. otherwise, return false.
