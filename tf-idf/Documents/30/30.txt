there is an m x n matrix that is initialized to all 0's. there is also a 2d array indices where each indices[i] = [ri, ci] represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.
for each location indices[i], do both of the following:
increment all the cells on row ri.
increment all the cells on column ci.
given m, n, and indices, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in indices.
