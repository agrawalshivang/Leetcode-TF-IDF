a triplet is an array of three integers. you are given a 2d integer array triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] describes the ith triplet. you are also given an integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the triplet you want to obtain.
to obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets any number of times (possibly zero):
choose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j) and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].
for example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].
return true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.
