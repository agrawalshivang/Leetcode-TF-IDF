given an integer array arr, return the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of arr.
a subarray is turbulent if the comparison sign flips between each adjacent pair of elements in the subarray.
more formally, a subarray [arr[i], arr[i + 1], ..., arr[j]] of arr is said to be turbulent if and only if:
for i <= k < j:
arr[k] > arr[k + 1] when k is odd, and
arr[k] < arr[k + 1] when k is even.
or, for i <= k < j:
arr[k] > arr[k + 1] when k is even, and
arr[k] < arr[k + 1] when k is odd.
