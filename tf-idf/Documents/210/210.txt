you are given an even integer n. you initially have a permutation perm of size n where perm[i] == i (0-indexed).
in one operation, you will create a new array arr, and for each i:
if i % 2 == 0, then arr[i] = perm[i / 2].
if i % 2 == 1, then arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2].
you will then assign arr to perm.
return the minimum non-zero number of operations you need to perform on perm to return the permutation to its initial value.
