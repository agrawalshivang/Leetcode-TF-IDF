you are given an m x n binary grid, where each 1 represents a brick and 0 represents an empty space. a brick is stable if:
it is directly connected to the top of the grid, or
at least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable.
you are also given an array hits, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. each time we want to erase the brick at the location hits[i] = (rowi, coli). the brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).
return an array result, where each result[i] is the number of bricks that will fall after the ith erasure is applied.
note that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.
