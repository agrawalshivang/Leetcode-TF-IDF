a k-booking happens when k events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., there is some time that is common to all k events.)
you are given some events [starttime, endtime), after each given event, return an integer k representing the maximum k-booking between all the previous events.
implement the mycalendarthree class:
mycalendarthree() initializes the object.
int book(int starttime, int endtime) returns an integer k representing the largest integer such that there exists a k-booking in the calendar.
