you are given a string s consisting of lowercase english letters, and you are allowed to perform operations on it. in one operation, you can replace a character in s with another lowercase english letter.
your task is to make s a palindrome with the minimum number of operations possible. if there are multiple palindromes that can be made using the minimum number of operations, make the lexicographically smallest one.
a string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
return the resulting palindrome string.
