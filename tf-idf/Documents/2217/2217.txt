you have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to n units. you are asked to place n boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. there are however some rules to placing the boxes:
you can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
if box x is placed on top of the box y, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.
given an integer n, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor.
