consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
for example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).
two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.
return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.
