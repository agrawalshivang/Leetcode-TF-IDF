you are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. the root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. the node with the number i has the label labels[i]).
the edges array is given on the form edges[i] = [ai, bi], which means there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
return an array of size n where ans[i] is the number of nodes in the subtree of the ith node which have the same label as node i.
a subtree of a tree t is the tree consisting of a node in t and all of its descendant nodes.
