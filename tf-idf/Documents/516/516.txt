you are given an array of strings of the same length words.
in one move, you can swap any two even indexed characters or any two odd indexed characters of a string words[i].
two strings words[i] and words[j] are special-equivalent if after any number of moves, words[i] == words[j].
for example, words[i] = "zzxy" and words[j] = "xyzz" are special-equivalent because we may make the moves "zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz".
a group of special-equivalent strings from words is a non-empty subset of words such that:
every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and
the group is the largest size possible (i.e., there is not a string words[i] not in the group such that words[i] is special-equivalent to every string in the group).
return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from words.
