you are given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] is the coordinates of the ith point on a 2d plane. multiple points can have the same coordinates.
you are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj] describes a circle centered at (xj, yj) with a radius of rj.
for each query queries[j], compute the number of points inside the jth circle. points on the border of the circle are considered inside.
return an array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.
