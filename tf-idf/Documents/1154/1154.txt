given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes ai and bi. a minimum spanning tree (mst) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (mst). an mst edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the mst weight to increase is called a critical edge. on the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some msts but not all.
note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.
