let the function f(s) be the frequency of the lexicographically smallest character in a non-empty string s. for example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the lexicographically smallest character is 'c', which has a frequency of 2.
you are given an array of strings words and another array of query strings queries. for each query queries[i], count the number of words in words such that f(queries[i]) < f(w) for each w in words.
return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
