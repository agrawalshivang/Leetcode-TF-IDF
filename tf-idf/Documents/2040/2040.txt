you are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of lengths m and n respectively. nums1 and nums2 represent the digits of two numbers. you are also given an integer k.
create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two numbers. the relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved.
return an array of the k digits representing the answer.
