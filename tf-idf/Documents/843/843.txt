you are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.
return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].
a subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
