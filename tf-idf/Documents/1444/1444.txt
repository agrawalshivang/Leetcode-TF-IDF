given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if nums has a good subarray or false otherwise.
a good subarray is a subarray where:
its length is at least two, and
the sum of the elements of the subarray is a multiple of k.
note that:
a subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
an integer x is a multiple of k if there exists an integer n such that x = n * k. 0 is always a multiple of k.
