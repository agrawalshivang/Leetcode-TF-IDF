you are given an array of integers arr and an integer target.
you have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with a sum equal target. there can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.
return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.
