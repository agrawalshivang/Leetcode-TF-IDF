you are given a positive integer p. consider an array nums (1-indexed) that consists of the integers in the inclusive range [1, 2p - 1] in their binary representations. you are allowed to do the following operation any number of times:
choose two elements x and y from nums.
choose a bit in x and swap it with its corresponding bit in y. corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the same position in the other integer.
for example, if x = 1101 and y = 0011, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have x = 1111 and y = 0001.
find the minimum non-zero product of nums after performing the above operation any number of times. return this product modulo 109 + 7.
note: the answer should be the minimum product before the modulo operation is done.
