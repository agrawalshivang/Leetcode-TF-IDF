you are given a binary string s. you are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:
type-1: remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string.
type-2: pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that s becomes alternating.
the string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.
for example, the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating, while the string "0100" is not.
