there is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. you are given a 2d array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. more formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. the graph has the following properties:
there are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
there are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
if v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
the graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
a graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets a and b such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set a and a node in set b.
return true if and only if it is bipartite.
