delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
the table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
if the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
the first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. it is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.
write an sql query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.
the query result format is in the following example.
