you are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. the beginning and end of the linked list will have node.val == 0.
for every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. the modified list should not contain any 0's.
return the head of the modified linked list.
