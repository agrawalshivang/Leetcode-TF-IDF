you are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers. you can choose two indices i and j, such that i != j, and the sum of digits of the number nums[i] is equal to that of nums[j].
return the maximum value of nums[i] + nums[j] that you can obtain over all possible indices i and j that satisfy the conditions.
