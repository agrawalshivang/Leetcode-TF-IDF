you are given an array target of n integers. from a starting array arr consisting of n 1's, you may perform the following procedure :
let x be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
choose index i, such that 0 <= i < n and set the value of arr at index i to x.
you may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.
return true if it is possible to construct the target array from arr, otherwise, return false.
