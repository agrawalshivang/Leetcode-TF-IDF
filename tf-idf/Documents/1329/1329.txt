you are given an m x n integer matrix grid, where m and n are both even integers, and an integer k.
the matrix is composed of several layers, which is shown in the below image, where each color is its own layer:
a cyclic rotation of the matrix is done by cyclically rotating each layer in the matrix. to cyclically rotate a layer once, each element in the layer will take the place of the adjacent element in the counter-clockwise direction. an example rotation is shown below:
return the matrix after applying k cyclic rotations to it.
