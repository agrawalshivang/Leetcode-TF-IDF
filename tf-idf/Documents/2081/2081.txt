an integer n is strictly palindromic if, for every base b between 2 and n - 2 (inclusive), the string representation of the integer n in base b is palindromic.
given an integer n, return true if n is strictly palindromic and false otherwise.
a string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
