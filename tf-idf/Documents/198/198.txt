one way to serialize a binary tree is to use preorder traversal. when we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. if it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as '#'.
for example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where '#' represents a null node.
given a string of comma-separated values preorder, return true if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.
it is guaranteed that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.
you may assume that the input format is always valid.
for example, it could never contain two consecutive commas, such as "1,,3".
note: you are not allowed to reconstruct the tree.
