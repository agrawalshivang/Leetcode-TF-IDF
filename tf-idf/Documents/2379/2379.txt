there exists an infinitely large grid. you are currently at point (1, 1), and you need to reach the point (targetx, targety) using a finite number of steps.
in one step, you can move from point (x, y) to any one of the following points:
(x, y - x)
(x - y, y)
(2 * x, y)
(x, 2 * y)
given two integers targetx and targety representing the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of your final position, return true if you can reach the point from (1, 1) using some number of steps, and false otherwise.
