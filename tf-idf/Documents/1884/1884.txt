you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] is a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
the triangular sum of nums is the value of the only element present in nums after the following process terminates:
let nums comprise of n elements. if n == 1, end the process. otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array newnums of length n - 1.
for each index i, where 0 <= i < n - 1, assign the value of newnums[i] as (nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10, where % denotes modulo operator.
replace the array nums with newnums.
repeat the entire process starting from step 1.
return the triangular sum of nums.
