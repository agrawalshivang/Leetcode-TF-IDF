a bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. we know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.
the bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.
return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.
