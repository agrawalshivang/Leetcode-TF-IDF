write a class that allows getting and setting key-value pairs, however a time until expiration is associated with each key.
the class has three public methods:
set(key, value, duration): accepts an integer key, an integer value, and a duration in milliseconds. once the duration has elapsed, the key should be inaccessible. the method should return true if the same un-expired key already exists and false otherwise. both the value and duration should be overwritten if the key already exists.
get(key): if an un-expired key exists, it should return the associated value. otherwise it should return -1.
count(): returns the count of un-expired keys.
