given a positive integer n, there exists a 0-indexed array called powers, composed of the minimum number of powers of 2 that sum to n. the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is only one way to form the array.
you are also given a 0-indexed 2d integer array queries, where queries[i] = [lefti, righti]. each queries[i] represents a query where you have to find the product of all powers[j] with lefti <= j <= righti.
return an array answers, equal in length to queries, where answers[i] is the answer to the ith query. since the answer to the ith query may be too large, each answers[i] should be returned modulo 109 + 7.
