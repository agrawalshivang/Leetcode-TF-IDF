given an integer array nums, find the maximum possible bitwise or of a subset of nums and return the number of different non-empty subsets with the maximum bitwise or.
an array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b. two subsets are considered different if the indices of the elements chosen are different.
the bitwise or of an array a is equal to a[0] or a[1] or ... or a[a.length - 1] (0-indexed).
