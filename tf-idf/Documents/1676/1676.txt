given an array nums of integers, a move consists of choosing any element and decreasing it by 1.
an array a is a zigzag array if either:
every even-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. a[0] > a[1] < a[2] > a[3] < a[4] > ...
or, every odd-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. a[0] < a[1] > a[2] < a[3] > a[4] < ...
return the minimum number of moves to transform the given array nums into a zigzag array.
