given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (bst).
a valid bst is defined as follows:
the left
subtree
of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
