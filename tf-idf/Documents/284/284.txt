on an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. note that:
the north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
the south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
the east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
the west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.
the robot can receive one of three instructions:
"g": go straight 1 unit.
"l": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
"r": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).
the robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.
return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.
