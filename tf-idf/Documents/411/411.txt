given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). otherwise, return false.
there may be duplicates in the original array.
note: an array a rotated by x positions results in an array b of the same length such that a[i] == b[(i+x) % a.length], where % is the modulo operation.
