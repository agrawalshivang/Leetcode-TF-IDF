you are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.
each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.
for example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
a leaf node is a node with no children.
