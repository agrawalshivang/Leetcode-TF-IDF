given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
the product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
you must write an algorithm that runs in o(n) time and without using the division operation.
