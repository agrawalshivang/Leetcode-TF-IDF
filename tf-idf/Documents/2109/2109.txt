given a binary tree root, return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a binary search tree (bst).
assume a bst is defined as follows:
the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
