you are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. there is a destination at position target.
you can make some number of moves nummoves so that:
on each move, you can either go left or right.
during the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == nummoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction.
given the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum nummoves) to reach the destination.
