you are given an integer n and an integer p in the range [0, n - 1]. representing a 0-indexed array arr of length n where all positions are set to 0's, except position p which is set to 1.
you are also given an integer array banned containing some positions from the array. for the ith position in banned, arr[banned[i]] = 0, and banned[i] != p.
you can perform multiple operations on arr. in an operation, you can choose a subarray with size k and reverse the subarray. however, the 1 in arr should never go to any of the positions in banned. in other words, after each operation arr[banned[i]] remains 0.
return an array ans where for each i from [0, n - 1], ans[i] is the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the 1 to position i in arr, or -1 if it is impossible.
a subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
the values of ans[i] are independent for all i's.
the reverse of an array is an array containing the values in reverse order.
