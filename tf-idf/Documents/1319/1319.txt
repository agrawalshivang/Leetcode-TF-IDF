you are given an n x n grid where we place some 1 x 1 x 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.
each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of the cell (i, j).
we view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.
a projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3-dimensional figure to a 2-dimensional plane. we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.
return the total area of all three projections.
