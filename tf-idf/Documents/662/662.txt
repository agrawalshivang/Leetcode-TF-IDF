you are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. you are also given two 2d integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.
a guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. a cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.
return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.
