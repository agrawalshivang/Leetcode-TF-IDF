you are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and an integer k. you can perform the following operation on nums1:
choose two indexes i and j and increment nums1[i] by k and decrement nums1[j] by k. in other words, nums1[i] = nums1[i] + k and nums1[j] = nums1[j] - k.
nums1 is said to be equal to nums2 if for all indices i such that 0 <= i < n, nums1[i] == nums2[i].
return the minimum number of operations required to make nums1 equal to nums2. if it is impossible to make them equal, return -1.
