you are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a 2d array of integers queries.
each query queries[i] = [li, ri] asks us to find the number of strings present in the range li to ri (both inclusive) of words that start and end with a vowel.
return an array ans of size queries.length, where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.
