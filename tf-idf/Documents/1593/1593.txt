given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length.
return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
the tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. you may not use the same element twice.
your solution must use only constant extra space.
