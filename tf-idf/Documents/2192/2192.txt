given a 2d integer array circles where circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri] represents the center (xi, yi) and radius ri of the ith circle drawn on a grid, return the number of lattice points that are present inside at least one circle.
note:
a lattice point is a point with integer coordinates.
points that lie on the circumference of a circle are also considered to be inside it.
