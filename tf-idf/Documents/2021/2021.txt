you have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.
to decrypt the code, you must replace every number. all the numbers are replaced simultaneously.
if k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
if k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
if k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
as code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].
given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!
