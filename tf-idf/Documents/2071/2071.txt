there are n items each belonging to zero or one of m groups where group[i] is the group that the i-th item belongs to and it's equal to -1 if the i-th item belongs to no group. the items and the groups are zero indexed. a group can have no item belonging to it.
return a sorted list of the items such that:
the items that belong to the same group are next to each other in the sorted list.
there are some relations between these items where beforeitems[i] is a list containing all the items that should come before the i-th item in the sorted array (to the left of the i-th item).
return any solution if there is more than one solution and return an empty list if there is no solution.
