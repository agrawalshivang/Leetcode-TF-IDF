there are n cities. some of them are connected, while some are not. if city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.
a province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.
you are given an n x n matrix isconnected where isconnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isconnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.
return the total number of provinces.
