given n points on a 2d plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.
a vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). the widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.
note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
