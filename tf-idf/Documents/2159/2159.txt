you are given an integer array nums of size n.
consider a non-empty subarray from nums that has the maximum possible bitwise and.
in other words, let k be the maximum value of the bitwise and of any subarray of nums. then, only subarrays with a bitwise and equal to k should be considered.
return the length of the longest such subarray.
the bitwise and of an array is the bitwise and of all the numbers in it.
a subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
