design a data structure that efficiently finds the majority element of a given subarray.
the majority element of a subarray is an element that occurs threshold times or more in the subarray.
implementing the majoritychecker class:
majoritychecker(int[] arr) initializes the instance of the class with the given array arr.
int query(int left, int right, int threshold) returns the element in the subarray arr[left...right] that occurs at least threshold times, or -1 if no such element exists.
