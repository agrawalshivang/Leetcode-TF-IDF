you are given a list of preferences for n friends, where n is always even.
for each person i, preferences[i] contains a list of friends sorted in the order of preference. in other words, a friend earlier in the list is more preferred than a friend later in the list. friends in each list are denoted by integers from 0 to n-1.
all the friends are divided into pairs. the pairings are given in a list pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi] denotes xi is paired with yi and yi is paired with xi.
however, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. a friend x is unhappy if x is paired with y and there exists a friend u who is paired with v but:
x prefers u over y, and
u prefers x over v.
return the number of unhappy friends.
