you are given a 0-indexed string s and are tasked with finding two non-intersecting palindromic substrings of odd length such that the product of their lengths is maximized.
more formally, you want to choose four integers i, j, k, l such that 0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length and both the substrings s[i...j] and s[k...l] are palindromes and have odd lengths. s[i...j] denotes a substring from index i to index j inclusive.
return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.
a palindrome is a string that is the same forward and backward. a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
