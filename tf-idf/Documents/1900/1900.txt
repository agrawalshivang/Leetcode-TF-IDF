you are given two 0-indexed integer permutations a and b of length n.
a prefix common array of a and b is an array c such that c[i] is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index i in both a and b.
return the prefix common array of a and b.
a sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.
