you are given two string arrays positive_feedback and negative_feedback, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. note that no word is both positive and negative.
initially every student has 0 points. each positive word in a feedback report increases the points of a student by 3, whereas each negative word decreases the points by 1.
you are given n feedback reports, represented by a 0-indexed string array report and a 0-indexed integer array student_id, where student_id[i] represents the id of the student who has received the feedback report report[i]. the id of each student is unique.
given an integer k, return the top k students after ranking them in non-increasing order by their points. in case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower id ranks higher.
