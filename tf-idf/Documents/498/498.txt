you are given two 0-indexed strings word1 and word2.
a move consists of choosing two indices i and j such that 0 <= i < word1.length and 0 <= j < word2.length and swapping word1[i] with word2[j].
return true if it is possible to get the number of distinct characters in word1 and word2 to be equal with exactly one move. return false otherwise.
