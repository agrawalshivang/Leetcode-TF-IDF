you may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:
arr.length >= 3
there exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain. return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.
