given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
recall that:
the node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
the depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
the lowest common ancestor of a set s of nodes, is the node a with the largest depth such that every node in s is in the subtree with root a.
