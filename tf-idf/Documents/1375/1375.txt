we have n chips, where the position of the ith chip is position[i].
we need to move all the chips to the same position. in one step, we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to:
position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0.
position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1.
return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.
