the xor total of an array is defined as the bitwise xor of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.
for example, the xor total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 xor 5 xor 6 = 1.
given an array nums, return the sum of all xor totals for every subset of nums.
note: subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.
an array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.
