you are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. each node is uniquely assigned a value from 1 to n. you are also given an integer startvalue representing the value of the start node s, and a different integer destvalue representing the value of the destination node t.
find the shortest path starting from node s and ending at node t. generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase letters 'l', 'r', and 'u'. each letter indicates a specific direction:
'l' means to go from a node to its left child node.
'r' means to go from a node to its right child node.
'u' means to go from a node to its parent node.
return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node s to node t.
