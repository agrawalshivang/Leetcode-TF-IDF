given n points on a 1-d plane, where the ith point (from 0 to n-1) is at x = i, find the number of ways we can draw exactly k non-overlapping line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. the endpoints of each segment must have integral coordinates. the k line segments do not have to cover all n points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.
return the number of ways we can draw k non-overlapping line segments. since this number can be huge, return it modulo 109 + 7.
