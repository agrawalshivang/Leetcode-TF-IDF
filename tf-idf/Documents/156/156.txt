given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.
find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. it's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.
notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
