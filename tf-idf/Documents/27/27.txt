given n cuboids where the dimensions of the ith cuboid is cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti] (0-indexed). choose a subset of cuboids and place them on each other.
you can place cuboid i on cuboid j if widthi <= widthj and lengthi <= lengthj and heighti <= heightj. you can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another cuboid.
return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.
