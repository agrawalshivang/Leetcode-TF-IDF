a boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either true or false. it can be in one of the following shapes:
't' that evaluates to true.
'f' that evaluates to false.
'!(subexpr)' that evaluates to the logical not of the inner expression subexpr.
'&(subexpr1, subexpr2, ..., subexprn)' that evaluates to the logical and of the inner expressions subexpr1, subexpr2, ..., subexprn where n >= 1.
'|(subexpr1, subexpr2, ..., subexprn)' that evaluates to the logical or of the inner expressions subexpr1, subexpr2, ..., subexprn where n >= 1.
given a string expression that represents a boolean expression, return the evaluation of that expression.
it is guaranteed that the given expression is valid and follows the given rules.
