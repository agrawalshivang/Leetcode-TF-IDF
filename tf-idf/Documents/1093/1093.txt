the alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.
for example, the alternating sum of [4,2,5,3] is (4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4.
given an array nums, return the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of nums (after reindexing the elements of the subsequence).
a subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. for example, [2,7,4] is a subsequence of [4,2,3,7,2,1,4] (the underlined elements), while [2,4,2] is not.
