there is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1.
you are given a 0-indexed integer array scores of length n where scores[i] denotes the score of node i. you are also given a 2d integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.
a node sequence is valid if it meets the following conditions:
there is an edge connecting every pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence.
no node appears more than once in the sequence.
the score of a node sequence is defined as the sum of the scores of the nodes in the sequence.
return the maximum score of a valid node sequence with a length of 4. if no such sequence exists, return -1.
