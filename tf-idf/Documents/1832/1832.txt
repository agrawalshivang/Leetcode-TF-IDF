the appeal of a string is the number of distinct characters found in the string.
for example, the appeal of "abbca" is 3 because it has 3 distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
given a string s, return the total appeal of all of its substrings.
a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
